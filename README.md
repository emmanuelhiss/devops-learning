# DevOps Learning Journey

Real-world infrastructure and DevOps projects, documented from scratch. No fluff, no copy-paste tutorials — just honest write-ups of what I built, what broke, and what I learned.

Currently building **[NexOps](https://github.com/emmanuelhiss/nexops)** — an open-source infrastructure management platform.

## About

I'm Emmanuel — a software developer transitioning into DevOps/Cloud engineering. These write-ups document everything I'm learning as I build production-grade infrastructure from a homelab up to cloud deployment.

Each write-up includes:
- What I set up and why
- The problems I hit and how I debugged them
- Screenshots of the actual setup
- Architecture diagrams
